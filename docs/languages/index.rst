Language Support Overview
-------------------------

Jiwar offers two types of language support:

1. **Built-in Corpora**: These languages have pre-loaded corpora and can be used immediately with Jiwar without any additional setup.

2. **Custom Corpus Support**: For languages without built-in corpora or when you want to use your own specific corpus, Jiwar allows you to use custom corpora.

For a full list of supported languages and their support type, please see the :doc:`supported` page.

If you need to use a custom corpus, whether for an unsupported language or for specific research needs, please refer to the :doc:`custom_corpus` page for instructions.
